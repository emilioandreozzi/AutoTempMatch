# AutoTempMatch
This repository contains code and demo data for a fully-automated template matching algorithm for ECG-free heartbeat detection in cardiomechanical signals.

The AutoTempMatch algorithm can be used to accurately localize heartbeats in cardiomechanical signals, like Seismocardiography, Gyrocardiography, Phonocardiography, and Forcecardiography signals, without the need for a simultaneous electrocardiography trace. The AutoTempMatch algorithm provides very high performance in localization of heartbeats and estimation of inter-beat intervals, also in cardiomechanical signals of patients with valvular heart diseases.

The AutoTempMatch has also proved effective in localizing heartbeats in Photoplethismography signals, and generally in mechanical pulse signals recorded via force sensors [5].

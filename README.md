# AutoTempMatch
This repository contains code and demo data for a fully-automated template matching algorithm for ECG-free heartbeat detection in cardiomechanical signals.
If you use the <b>AutoTempMatch</b> algorithm in your research, please cite the the following article:

<h3><i>Parlato, S., Centracchio, J., Esposito, D., Bifulco, P., & Andreozzi, E. (2025). Fully Automated Template Matching Method for ECG-Free Heartbeat Detection in Cardiomechanical Signals of Healthy and Pathological Subjects. Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13246-025-01531-3</i></h3>

The <b>AutoTempMatch</b> algorithm can be used to accurately localize heartbeats in cardiomechanical signals, like Seismocardiography, Gyrocardiography, Phonocardiography, and Forcecardiography signals, without the need for a simultaneous electrocardiography trace. The <b>AutoTempMatch</b> algorithm provides very high performance in localization of heartbeats and estimation of inter-beat intervals, also in cardiomechanical signals of patients with valvular heart diseases.

The <b>AutoTempMatch</b> algorithm has also proved effective in localizing heartbeats in Photoplethismography signals, and generally in mechanical pulse signals recorded via force sensors <sup>5</sup>.
